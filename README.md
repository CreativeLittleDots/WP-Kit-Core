# wp-kit/core

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of ```wp-kit```. If you want to build your theme using ```wp-kit```, visit the main [wp-kit/theme](https://github.com/wp-kit/theme).

## Discontinued

This repo has been discontinued to make way for [```wp-kit/foundation```](https://github.com/wp-kit/foundation) and [```wp-kit components```](https://github.com/wp-kit).

```wp-kit/core``` is a dependancy of [```wp-kit/theme:1.*```](https://github.com/wp-kit/theme/releases/tag/1.5.5) and [```wp-kit/standalone```](https://github.com/wp-kit/standalone) only.

```wp-kit/theme:2.*``` depends on several [```wp-kit components```](https://github.com/wp-kit) which were originally a part of ```wp-kit/core```.

This major change in ```wp-kit/theme:2.*``` was to allow more flexibility in adding ServiceProviders to ```wp-kit/theme``` and resulted in an unavoidable overhaul that deemed ```wp-kit/core``` redundant.

## Requirements
